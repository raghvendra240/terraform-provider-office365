#### API Authentication
1. To authenticate API, we need these credentials: ObjectID ,TenantID and ClientSecret.
2.  Generate a new key for your application by following [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/office-365-management-api/get-started-with-office-365-management-apis#generate-a-new-key-for-your-application)


## Building The Provider 
1. Clone the repository, add all the dependencies and create a vendor directory that contains all dependencies. For this, run the following commands: <br>
```
cd terraform-provider-office365
go mod init terraform-provider-office365
go mod tidy
go mod vendor
```

## Managing terraform plugins
*For Windows:*
1. Run the following command to create a vendor sub-directory (`%APPDATA%/terraform.d/plugins/${host_name}/${namespace}/${type}/${version}/${OS_ARCH}`) which will consist of all terraform plugins. <br> 
Command: 
```bash
mkdir -p %APPDATA%/terraform.d/plugins/office365.com/users/office365/1.0.0/windows_amd64
```
2. Run `go build -o terraform-provider-office365.exe` to generate the binary in present working directory. <br>
3. Run this command to move this binary file to the appropriate location.
 ```
 move terraform-provider-office365.exe %APPDATA%\terraform.d\plugins\office356.com\users\office365\1.0.0\windows_amd64
 ``` 
<p align="center">[OR]</p>
 
3. Manually move the file from current directory to destination directory (`%APPDATA%\terraform.d\plugins\office365.com\users\office365\1.0.0\windows_amd64`).<br>

## Working with terraform

### Application Credential Integration in terraform
1. Add `terraform` block and `provider` block as shown in [example usage](#example-usage).
2. Get credentials: ObjectID ,TenantID and ClientSecret. For this, visit https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app#add-credentials
3. Assign the above credentials to the respective field in the `provider` block.

### Basic Terraform Commands
1. `terraform init` - To initialize a working directory containing Terraform configuration files.
2. `terraform plan` - To create an execution plan. Displays the changes to be done.
3. `terraform apply` - To execute the actions proposed in a Terraform plan. Apply the changes.

### Create User
1. Add the `display_name`, `password`, `mail_nick_name`, `user_principal_name`,  in the respective field in `resource` block as shown in [example usage](#example-usage).
2. Run the basic terraform commands.<br>
3. On successful execution, Created new office365 user

### Update the user
1. Update the data of the user in the `resource` block as show in [example usage](#example-usage) and run the basic terraform commands to update user. 
3. User is not allowed to update `password` and `user_principal_name`.
2. To activate user, set account_enabled=true and vice-versa

### Read the User Data
Add `data` and `output` blocks as shown in the [example usage](#example-usage) and run the basic terraform commands.

### Delete the user
Delete the `resource` block of the user and run `terraform apply`.

### Import a User Data
1. Write manually a `resource` configuration block for the user as shown in [example usage](#example-usage). Imported user will be mapped to this block.
2. Run the command `terraform import office365_user.exmaple  [user_principal_name]` to import user.
3. Run `terraform plan`, if output shows `0 to addd, 0 to change and 0 to destroy` user import is successful.
